Lab
1.	As the developer user, create a new project named schedule-pods
2.	Create a new application named hello using the container located at quay.io/redhattraining/hello-world-nginx:v1.0
3.	Create a service for the application.
4.	Make the service accessible by creating a route to it.
5.	Manually scale the application so there are four running pods
6.	Prepare the worker nodes so that application workloads can be distributed to either development or production nodes by assigning the env label. Assign the env=dev label to the first worker node and the env=prod label to the second worker node.
7.	Switch back to the developer user and modify the hello application so that it is deployed to the development node
8.	Verify that the application pods are deployed to the node with the env=dev label. Although it makes take a little time to redeploy, the application pods must be deployed to the same worker node that previously identified.
9.	Remove the schedule-pods project.
10.	Removing the env label from the worker nodes.
