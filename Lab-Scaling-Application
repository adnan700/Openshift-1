Lab
1.	Log in to your OpenShift cluster as the admin user. Label the two worker nodes with the tier label. Give one worker node the label of tier=gold and the other worker node the label of tier=silver.
2.	Switch to the developer user and create a new project named schedule-review.
3.	Create a new application named loadtest using the container image located at quay.io/redhattraining/loadtest:v1.0. 
4.	The loadtest application should be deployed to nodes labeled with tier=silver. Ensure that each container requests 100m of CPU and 20Mi of memory.
5.	Create a route to your application named loadtest using the default (automatically generated) host name. Depending on how you created your application, you might need to create a service before creating the route. Your application works as expected if running curl http://loadtest-chedulereview.apps.cluster.domain.example.com/api/loadtest/v1/healthz returns 
{"health":"ok"}.
6.	Create a horizontal pod autoscaler named loadtest for the loadtest application that will scale from 2 pods to a maximum of 40 pods if CPU load exceeds 70%. You can test the horizontal pod autoscaler with the following command: curl -X GET http://loadtest-schedule-review.apps.cluster.domain.example.com/api/loadtest/v1/cpu/3
7.	As the admin user, implement a quota named review-quota on the schedule-review project. Limit  the schedule-review project to a maximum of 1 full CPU, 2G of memory, and 20 pods.
